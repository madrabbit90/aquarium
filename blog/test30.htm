<p>"All these facts and opinions look the same! I can't tell them apart!"</p>
<p>"Happens to me all the time. Don't worry about it."</p>
<p>--<i>Inside </i><i>Out </i>(2015)</p>
<p>We are the Divided States of America, the home of the offended, I hear constantly. And the solution, it seems, is to unify mankind under a single rallying point or banner. Except, you know, that whole Tower of Babel thing didn't work out so well for us, did it? Regardless, I believe such calls to action obfuscate the real point.</p>
<p>When our nation's constitution was written, the Bill of Rights was still just an idea, several states refusing to vote for its ratification unless they were guranteed its inclusion, chief among these being freedom of speech and press.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Look no further than those throughout history who were jailed (or worse!) for peacefully assembling, speaking their heart and mind, and printing truth. And yet, this freedom is a two-way street. One cannot uphold his own freedoms while trampling upon the rights of others. After all, "your liberty ends where my nose begins".</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong. There are concrete facts that are objectively, factually, and/or morally right or wrong. We should and must stand for these principles. However, it is elevating opinions to the status of inalienable truth where the problems begin.</p>
<p>Need evidence?</p>
<p>The reason why social networks such as Facebook and The Micro-Blogging Platform Formerly Known as Twitter quickly turn into battlegrounds lies in their very nature. Users are not encouraged to think, consider and reason. They are encouraged to spout off the first thing that pops in their head with prompts like "What's on your mind?" Instead of stopping to see opinions as contrary to fact or as someone's prerogative to disagree with someone else, we react on raw emotion and reflex, attacking people instead of the injustice we supposedly oppose.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is not a "New Media=Bad" discourse. All I'm saying is that it's entirely possible to totally disagree with someone and still have respect for their opinion and point of view. So why don't we? I propose two possibilities.</p>
<p>One: Public education has failed. No one actually remembers the difference between facts and opinions. Truth is relative and easily changed. Opinions stated loudly enough and backed-up by enough people can easily become fact. This possibility in and of itself is frightening enough, but the second, in my opinion is far worse.</p>
<p>Two: We have become so numb to the basic needs of our fellow human beings that we forget that behind opinions with which we disagree are real people with real feelings and real families. While true, the anonymity effect of an online echo-chamber hasn't helped, this is not a new problem. After all, Jesus took flak for reaching out to the very people he came to save.</p>
<p>I think this is what's meant by the concept of "truth in love."</p>
<p>Subjectivity is a very fine-tuned skill that must be practiced. When learned well, we can hear the voice of truth over the megaphones of elevated public opinion and disagree with opinion without resorting to personally attacking its holder, be it in the field of politics or pizza toppings.</p>
<p>When learned badly, there is little wonder why sensational headlines sell subscriptions and inflammatory remarks get clicks. It's a feedback loop so easy to fall into.</p>
<p>The real trick is knowing the difference between what matters, what doesn't, and being able to boldly say, "I disagree, but I still love you." And that speaks volumes.</p>
<p>But, you know, that's just my opinion.</p>
