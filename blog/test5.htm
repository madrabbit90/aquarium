<p>I have come to terms with co-existing with AI, but one thing still bugs me about it...</p>

<p>What is it about AI generated content that's so off-putting? As good as it has become in such a short time, something about it still strikes us as strange yet oddly fascinating. What is it? I think I can finally put my finger on it...</p>

<p>After several nights of fitful sleep and some real doozy nightmares, I discovered a pattern. None of my dreams could be construed as "scary" in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>In my dreams, I explored a big open mansion. I took a road trip with friends. I revisited memories from my youth. I even got to play in a band. ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>All cool, right? But here's the thing...</p>

<p>In that big house, I had this feeling I had been there before, and places where people should be, there weren't.</p>

<p>A road trip with my friends was hot and claustrophobic, and for the life of me I couldn't remember anyone's face.</p>

<p>Memories from my youth kept getting mixed with memories from this week and scenes from 90's sitcoms, and everyone seemed to be angry with me.</p>

<p>Playing in a band was stressful because the sheet music made no sense and the instrument kept changing shape mid-performance.</p>

<p>Nothing was real. Just some jumbled-up bits-and-bobs from my subconscious being reassembled like a jigsaw puzzle with half its pieces missing.</p>

<p>And I realized... I'm not really experiencing these things. I'm experiencing my brain's interpretation of what these things are supposed to be while it fills in the gaps of what it can't remember and trying desperately to make sense of it all. The result is the uncanny mix of the familiar yet surreal.</p>

<p>When real people create things, they are based on other real people, real places, real experiences. We experience them with the creator.</p>

<p>When computers create things, we are likewise experiencing a computer's interpretation of what these things are supposed to be. But here's the rub. Computers don't truly understand any of it. It merely regurgitates what it has been fed. Desperarely trying to make sense of all the jumbled-up random bits-and-bobs from its database.</p>

<p>The result is, dare I say, dreamlike.</p>

<p>This is why the "personalized Super Mario 64" urban legend captured our imaginations. As ludicrous as the idea is, the game's tech limits truly feel like what an AI's interpretation of a castle would look and feel like.</p>

<p>That and it was 2020 and we had nothing else better to do. ðŸ™ƒ</p>

<p>Investors are betting the farm on AI and proponents say it is the future. Meanwhile, I think this is the part of Alice's dream when she looks at the "baby" she has rescued from the duchess and realizes that he has turned into a pig.</p>

<p>This will be the era of internet history when we watch the squealing swine run away into the woods while the Cheshire Cat grins. Watching wide-eyed, we shrug our shoulders and say...</p>

<p>Wake up! You're having that dream again!</p>
