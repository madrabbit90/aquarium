<p>It's so easy to complain about user interfaces that irritate you. But what happens when you stumble across something you love?</p>

<p>Dinosaur Polo Club's <i>Mini Metro</i> is one of the most calming, relaxing games I have played in ages. And yet, <i>Mini Metro</i> has no right to be as calming and relaxing at it is.</p>

<p>The premise is as follows:</p>

<p>Connect a series of metro stations by railway, juggling multiple lines at once, to get commuters from point A to point B. The more riders your railway gets, the more stations open to make your job more difficult. If a single station over-crowds, it's game over. Accumulate as many riders as you can before your inevitable failure.</p>

<p>This sounds like the perfect storm of anxiety, and yet... it's not...</p>

<p>...but why?</p>

<p>I believe it all boils down to UI and presentation.</p>

<p>First, <i>Mini Metro</i> uses a simple art style of colored lines and shapes reminiscent of what one would find in a real metro station. At a glance, the player can easily tell apart lines, cars, passengers,  stations, stress points and bodies of water. Everything the player needs and nothing he doesn't is completely spelled out in primary colors.</p>

<p>The art style also serves to lower the stakes. Never once must you face an angry passenger with an armload of kids, swearing at you and threatening to report you to the department of transportation. Simply shuttle the triangles to triangle station, the squares to square station, and... well, you get the idea.</p>

<p>Second, <i>Mini Metro</i> doesn't overwhelm the player by laying all the cards on the table at once. The map is zoomed-in just enough to navigate the handful of open stations and the player is given just enough lines and tunnels to feel in control.</p>

<p>Only when more stations open does the map slowly zoom out and only when completing an in-game "week" does the player get a choice of tools to add to his reserves. Never more than a "this-or-that" choice, and always open to playstyle instead of railroading (pun intended) the player into a "correct" decision.</p>

<p>Finally, <i>Mini Metro</i> never makes the player feel like an idiot for failure. Nor does it hold past failure over his head or shame him for needing help. Moves are never set in stone and can easily be moved, undone and replaced.</p>

<p>The "Game Over" screen is very matter-of-fact. A station is crowded and here is your final passenger count. Instead of rubbing it in the player's face, he has the option of continuing the scenario in "Endless Mode" to further tinker with the game mechanics or quickly start a clean slate to take another crack at the high score.</p>

<p>I first discovered <i>Mini Metro</i> on sale after a difficult week at work. An experience that should have stressed me out had me grinning like an idiot during its opening moments.</p>

<p>And to this day, it's one of my go-to games for whenever I need to unwind, and I believe so many pieces of non-game software can take notes from Dinosaur Polo Club's masterpiece.</p>
