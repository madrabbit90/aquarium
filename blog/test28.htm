<center><p><b>Empathetic</b></p></center>
<p>Much is said about the need for more empathy in the home, in the workplace, in the world. And... as it should. The ability to put one's self in the shoes of another and see their point of view is a valuable skill that's difficult to pin down, much less teach, but is necessary to get along with one's fellow man.</p>
<p>This is opposed to "sympathy", which is simply offering condolances. The definition is servicable, but I don't believe it goes far enough.</p>
<p>Just imagining yourself in someone else's shoes still has an air of aloofness, equating to the pharisaical "I see their point, but God, I thank you that I am not like them." But that's not the point.</p>

<p>The point is knowing deep down that under any different circumstances, that person in trouble, in the depths of despair, at the end of their rope, that person staring you in the face silently pleading, that person is you. You are no longer a bystander wishing them well. You understand them.</p>
<p>You <b>get </b>it.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by "judge not lest ye be judged." Don't get me wrong. Judging right from wrong is completely objective and must be judged from a point of authority. We cannot, however, judge the circumstances that brought someone to this point. This situation could just have easily been yours.</p>
<p>But let's take it a step further.</p>
<p>When someone has fallen into a river, it's easy to tell them why they're there and what they could do to prevent being so stupid and careless in the future. It's slightly more difficult to see their situation and offer gentle, guiding words of encouragement.</p>
<p>However, the most difficult of all is to step waist-deep into the river with them, no matter how cold, how wet, or how muddy, grab hold of the rock on the bank, reach out a hand and say, "I'm here with you."</p>
<p>This is the pinnacle of empathy, what the Greeks call <i>agape</i>, the Christ-like love of John 3:16. While it's true that we need more empathy the home, in the workplace, in the world this is what that empathy looks like. It goes beyond simple platitudes and requires real love, real forgiveness and real sacrifice.</p>
<p>Are we ready?</p>
