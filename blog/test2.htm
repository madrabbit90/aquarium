<p>Accessibility is more than just high contrast color schemes, trackballs and text-to-speech models with British accents.</p>

<p>Brain fog and anxiety are real. People make us feel like idiots, being berated because we don't understand, we need clarification, or we misunderstood something "painfully obvious"? Yes, it's lousy, yet we do this to our users all the time.</p>

<p>Push nonsensical UIs. Promise "accessibility", then punish people for using it. Fix nothing because hey, we're creating IT jobs, amirite?</p>

<p>I get it. I worked in IT. Users can be a pain. But maybe the user interface really IS too complicated, and we're too accustomed to it to know the difference. And instead of listening to them, we berate them as "dummies" for not being able to speak our language.</p>

<p>And yet there is nothing I can do. I am paid to champion a decrepit system that should have died in the mid 2000's.</p>

<p>If we're going make inroads in taking accessibility seriously, accessibility should be a priority in UX/UI design, not just an option or a bullet-point. It's not "dumbing down" the interface. It's giving your user the tools to do their job.</p>

<p>In game design, a player must know at a glance vital information about his status, where his opponents are, where they will be in any given timeframe, and what he can/cannot interact with, while also encouraging the player to give it "one more go".</p>

<p>Is it unreasonable to expect my office software to do the same thing? Its for writing words, not launching missiles! And don't feed me this "essential features" tripe. Nothing but clutter that looks pretty on the showroom floor. Who besides an octopus will be using all these features all at once? Who is this even made for?</p>

<p>I am jaded. "Award winning customer support" is a red flag. A sick joke. I shouldn't even be aware that my software exists much less worry that it will break to the point of phoning a helpdesk from India.</p>

<p>Good tools are those that are an extension of you. They don't just work. They disappear. Until then, they are just one more anxiety trigger waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Nice try, guys, but we're not there yet.</p><meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url='https://madrabbit90.github.io/aquarium/?type=blog&page=test2'" />
