<p><center><b>Robot </b><b>Perspective</b></center></p>
<p>Recently, our family decided to purchase a robot vacuum and make it our household "pet". Since then, our floor certainly has never been cleaner, but not for the reason you might think:</p>
<p>You see, just because something is new and modern doesn't always mean it's better. For instance, the mere fact that you're using a computer or a cloud-based service in lieu of carbon-and-paper filing doesn't make your data and workflow automatically more efficient. It doesn't just boil down to consistancy and rules. It's all about how the pieces fit together as a cohesive whole, regardless of whether or not your co-worker understands your esoteric systems.</p>
<p>This is a common refrain in my consultation sessions regarding data maintenance, but I believe it bears repeating. The key to clean, usable data is to see your database input as if a machine is going to read it. It doesn't matter if your technician, your customers, or your boss can read it. If a running background service can't run through your data set, make sense of it, and trigger processes, you might as well be etching your data onto clay tablets.</p>
<p>Blunt? Yes, absolutely. But sometimes a little bluntness is necessary to make it perfectly clear what you have, and what exactly it is that you're designing for. And nowhere else is this mechanical bluntness more necessary than when performing one of mankind's most dreaded tasks...</p>
<p>Decluttering.</p>
<p>Minimalist or not, the trickiest part of keeping a clutter-free zone is to make sure everyone is on the same clutter-free page. Not easy when several people occupy that zone, and even more difficult when half of said people are kids. And when your floorplan is rather... umm... shall we say... "limited", decluttering isn't only a great idea; it's essential to your survival.</p>
<p>Deep down, we all know this, but what makes this difficult is the fact that we all have a different idea of "trash" and "treasure", "clean" and "dirty", "chaos" and "organization". With kids, this can be moreso seen as having gone "clutter-blind" to junk-strewn floors. You bemoan the messy house, but they fail to see the problem. After all, they have the innate ability to tip-toe and dance around their piles and expect everyone else to do the same. Make them clean it up, and you're the bad guy, a totalitarian dictator forcing your standards on someone else. </p>
<p>Enter the robot vacuum. We brought the little guy into our home with the promise of effortlessly clean floors. What I <i>didn't </i>divulge, however, was my plan to introduce a machine's-eye view of our house to our family's cleaning routine.</p>
<p>Despite all the trappings of a "smart" device, robot vacuums are actually very simple little creatures. It starts at its home base, and spins around here and there, bouncing an infrared laser around the house and storing a simple two-dimensional map of it in memory. Then, it calculates the fastest, most efficient route to roam every explorable square inch of the map, and gets to it, retracing its steps back to home base when it's done.</p>
<p>Though it lacks intelligence, its blind cheerfulness and plucky tenacity to overcome any obstacle to rid the world of dust bunnies is admirable and--dare I say--endearingly adorable. It's like having our own R2-D2, but without the sass and attitude.</p>
<p>What this means for our household is that keeping a tidy house means more than just satisfying the arbitrary whims of its owners. It now means taking care of an electronic "pet". Make sure he has plenty of room to exercise. Don't crowd spaces so he can find his way home at night. Keep paper, cables and laundry off the floor so he doesn't choke. Clean his "litter box" to keep him healthy. </p>
<p>We are no longer the bad guy, and through a new addition to the family, our kids have learned to view our house through the eyes of a robot, tidying up as if a machine will be scooting through it.</p>
<p>And, you know what? For the first time in months, I can actually see my living room floor.</p>
