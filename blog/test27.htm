<p>After months of swapping out my android home launcher more often than most businessmen change their socks, I finally came to the conclusion that I would never be satisfied. So I did something drastic.</p>
<p>I deleted my home launcher once and for all.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. The home screen is essential and is the first friendly face you see when you first unlock your phone or tablet. But for the past few weeks, I've been living without a homescreen on my android device as an experiment. The "Home" button now redirects to my dialer and a slide-out side panel launches my everyday apps. I expected this to be a big adjustment, but honestly, it's been a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Trying to change the function of a home launcher is like teaching a fish to bark. For all the bluster about mindfulness apps and uncluttered home launchers, that's not what they're built for.</p>
<p>The launcher app's whole <b>purpose </b>is to redirect your attention, and I have yet to find one that doesn't annoy me in some way, shape or form. Widgets, icons, notifications. There's a reason why such a large chunk of marketing budget is poured into app development in a desperate attempt to plant corporate branding into a user's personal space.</p>
<p>Is nothing sacred?</p>

<p>A few days ago, I noticed that only one appliance in our house makes noise. The oven. Rightfully so, as if the oven doesn't alert its user, its contents will burn. Everything else comes equipped with timers, auto shut-offs and delays, rendering any system of notifications redundant. So what?</p>
<p>So, we live in a world where everything is a notification. Appliances demand our attention. Apps ding our phones. Shoe sales are top priority. Every headline is late-breaking news. Every scrap of info is essential. Every email, voicemail, text and communiqu√© is urgent.</p>
<p>And as the modern adage goes, when everything is marked "urgent", nothing is urgent.</p>
<p>I went through a similar transition period when I learned how to customize my Linux installs from scratch. No desktop icons or start menu. No sounds unless connected to a pair of headphones. No Facebook. No email notifications. The computer was still perfectly usable, and much easier to use after realizing that 95% of a computer's clamboring for your attention is useless fluff, anyway.</p>
<p>And I reiterate. I am no luddite. Quite the contrary. For the first time, the computer in my pocket truly feels like a computer.</p>
<p>Just like in the home, when all the appliances make noise, the noise no longer means anything. You start to tune it out. Just one more thing endlessly vying for your attention. Because after all, when everything in the house goes "beep beep"...</p>
<p>...nothing goes "beep beep".</p>
