<p><center><b>No More Solutions</b></center></p>
<p>In conversational marketing-ese there is a commonly uttered phrase. "We don't design products, we offer solutions." It's simple. It's succinct. It's proactive. It's comforting... ...And I hate it. Why? Because it implies two very incorrect and dangerous assumptions.</p>
<p>First, it implies that all problems can be solved swiftly by throwing enough money at it, wrapping it up in shiny paper and topping it with a pretty bow. In reality, some problems are messier than others and can take months, even years, to solve. They require getting your hands dirty, minimalizing processes, and finding out what works for you.</p>
<p>Second, it implies that there is a "correct" solution for problems, and that the holders of these solutions are the gatekeepers because they possess the brains and resources to do things properly. In reality, they are merely tools, and as long as it accomplishes its purpose without breaking things in the process, who cares if a screwdriver is a $350 motorized socket set from Black &amp; Decker or a $5 dollar store gift from your kids? If it works the best for you, what does it matter?</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought in the consumer software realm. The first is to accept what comes pre-installed on your system, no matter what, and learn how to put up with its counter-intuitiveness and idiosyncracies until it becomes ingrained as second nature, blaming any deficiencies on your own "computer illiteracy". Everyone is using it and it's there for a reason. The second is to go off the beaten path and "distro hop", finding the holy grail of openness and useability, extolling its virtues above all else, including the rights and opinions of others.</p>
<p>The older I've gotten, though, the more I realize that neither of these schools are correct.</p>
<p>Honestly, yes, software and standards should be more open and human readable, but the whole point isn't to trade a costly vendor lock-in solution for a cheaper or open-source one. The point is that we agree that all screws and bolts work exactly the same, and whatever screwdriver you use to drive it in is purely a matter of personal preference. At the end of the day, regardless of the tools you use, the results should be virtually indistinguishable.</p>
<p>To do any sort of modern productivity computing, there are certain types of applications you will always need. You're gonna need a text editor, a web browser, a mail client, and possibly a word processor, a spreadsheet, a photo editor and a file manager,... just to name a few. All I need is a tool that can help perform these tasks. How do I choose my tools? Product reviews? Marketing emails? Brand loyalty? Nope.</p>
<p>If I want to find my new go-to code editor, for instance, I download and install a whole bunch of them and let them all slug it out for supremacy in a gladiator deathmatch.</p>
<p>Yes, seriously.</p>
<p>In the first event, I can safely eliminate quite a few contenders. Obviously, anything that doesn't function at all or requires a subscription just for basic functions or for holding your data captive are eliminated immediately. Also eliminated are packages that tack on an eye-wateringly massive amount of megabytes that have nothing whatsoever to do with text editing, and packages that insist on redecorating my desktop and/or making itself at home with my settings. I don't need that kind of negativity in my life.</p>
<p>In the next event, the applications are put through their paces. Whenever any of them do something divisive, destructive, or just hair-pullingly annoying, out it goes. Now, it comes down to the finals.</p>
<p>Now yes, I am completely aware that there is no such thing as perfection. That's why the final criteria depends on how easily I can mold the tools to my will, my preferences, and my use cases. Does the application allow me to rebind hotkeys, or does it insist upon using it as the designer intended? Can I re-layout the interface and change colors to suit my accessibility needs, or does the application toss accessibility to the wind for the sake of being "on-brand"? Does the application play nice with my already existing toolkit, or does it insist on using its own friends bundled together in a suite? Putting in the work to make the experience "mine" isn't something to which I'm a stranger. The deciding factor is, rather, how much does the application fight back while I am attempting to do so?</p>
<p>When the dust settles and the fighting is over, there can only be one victor, and to the victor belongs the spoils. This is the tool I use and will continue to use until it breaks, stops updating, or does something obnoxiously stupid. No file format woes or data migration worries. Just a simple drop-in replacement. Will this new tool be a solution to all my problems? Of course not, nor do I expect it to be. Nor do I expect it to solve everyone else's problems.</p>
<p>After all, I am fully aware that I live in an oblivious world under the iron grip of Microsoft Office. That's why I use Pandoc to convert documents sent to me from Windows PCs and to convert back documents to send to users who stubbornly demand the .docx format, rather than standing on my open-source soapbox.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, we should be able to see "solution providers" for the late-night infomercial pitchmen they really are, and our tools should make little difference, the recipients being none the wiser. And when all is said and done, I'm just glad I can use whatever tools I want, and that in a world demanding expensive turn-key solutions, no one has to know that all I used was a $5 screwdriver.</p>
