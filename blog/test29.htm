<center><p><b>Loving </b><b>to </b><b>Hate </b><b>the </b><b>Flat </b><b>Surface</b></p></center>
<p>I don't like flat surfaces in living space design. Simple. And yet it's not that simple.</p>
<p>It goes beyond just one more dust magnet to clean. It goes beyond just the fact that flat surfaces attract clutter from all corners of the globe. It goes beyond it being a convenient storage spot for an afternoon organizing project to become "someone else's problem". It even goes beyond my dislike for them in the digital space.</p>
<p>Flat surfaces are something I wish I could love as a graphic designer, seeing the beauty of empty space in composition, but something about them just bristles my fur like a well-meaning animal fancier who just wants to pet the cute kitty and gets a handful of teeth.</p>
<p>And the more I discover about the way my brain processes information and the way I naturally organize things (or lack thereof), the more my dislike of flat surfaces becomes rooted in mutual exclusivity, not sheer, blind hatred.</p>

<p>Simply put, flat surfaces are in opposition to my nature.</p>
<p>I use bookshelves because I can organize my books, board games, movies, what-have-you, and see what I have at a glance. I use hooks and clothes-hangers to put away bags and garments for the same reason. Doubly so for dropping all my digital payload into a single folder and letting my computer sort it out.</p>
<p>I like having all my everyday items visible. When a portion of my shelves, hooks or hard drives become overwhelming and cluttered, it's easy to see the bottlenecks and get rid of things or relegate them to archival storage. That's just how my brain works. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Drawers, boxes, and yes, flat surfaces run counter to this. Drawers stay disheveled because their contents are constantly being rummaged through. Labeled boxes have no rhyme or reason because after a week of use, the labels are no longer relevant. Flat surfaces stay forever cluttered because it is the last bastion of visibility to those of us whose brains demand it.</p>
<p>I wish I could see countertops, coffee tables and dressers for what they are: beautiful swathes of neutral ground that gives living space room to breathe, and accents for conversation pieces.</p>
<p>As is, though, all I see are junk traps.</p>
<p>Maybe once I've re-construcred my living spaces to suit a house full of visual butterflies who drop an armload of junk on the first available flat surface and jump from one activity to the next without thought to the trail of bits and bobs left in their wake, I can let my guard down. Maybe once I've achieved the holy grail of a perfectly organized computer interface that I no longer have to fight, I can appreciate its beauty.</p>
<p>Until then, the "flat surface curse" will forever be the element of interior and UI design that I love to hate.</p>
