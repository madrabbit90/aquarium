<center><p><b>Busy </b><b>Bees</b></p></center>
<p>To be like a bee is said to be ever busy, never complaining, unceasingly dedicated to one's profession, useful to everyone around him, and always productive. Every goal is met, there is virtually no downtime, and each year is better than the last. This is reality and expectation.</p>
<p>But one interesting fact made me question this notion.</p>
<p>In Rowan Jacobsen's book, Fruitless Fall, several factors are blamed for the downfall of the honeybee, but one very familiar culprit caught my attention. In certain apiaries, honeybees were expected to produce enough product to meet demand, and as demand increased as profits rose, so too did expectations of the bees' output. They were expected to be as busy as... well... bees.</p>

<p>Except... bees don't work like this in nature. Bees don't produce to climbing profit margins. They have up and down seasons, times to work and times to recover, even periods when they don't produce at all.</p>
<p>Still, bees were expected to meet shareholder standards, not nature's. As a result, these bees were more susceptible to disease. They got sick.</p>
<p>They died.</p>
<p>Sometimes motivation works in reverse. Instead of feeling capable of conquering the world, you feel worse: defective for feeling sad and defeated for not meeting the world's demands. Maybe, then, if we really want to be busy bees, we have to rethink what it means.</p>
<p>Bees are industrious, but aren't expected to do everything themselves. They depend on each other for support and their Creator for sustenance.</p>
<p>Bees somehow understand this. We don't.</p>
<p>Just saying...</p>
