<center><p><b>24 Hours</b></p></center>
<p>I use 24 hour time. There are 24 hours in a day, so there's 24 hours on my clock. Simple.</p>
<p>"But why?" I often hear. "Why would anyone in their right mind use 24 hour time when everyone else uses 12 hour unless they're a military brat, an elitist snob, or some kind of nut?" To which I would reply,</p>
<p>Wow, that's not a loaded question at all. ðŸ™„</p>
<p>But let's ignore all that and just tackle the basics. Why do I use 24 hour time?</p>
<p>I knew what "military time" was growing up, but I started properly using it while learning Linux. The system tray clock could be set to 12 hour, but timestamps were encoded in 24 hour, so learning how to mentally convert on the fly was a must.</p>
<p>This was also when I worked graveyard shifts.</p>
<p>The funny thing about clocks is that when you're awake for the 12 hours that display on a sundial, 12 hour time makes perfect sense. When your day overlaps at the point when today becomes tomorrow, the AM/PM distinction is stupid. Graveyard shifts complicate this, creating a sort of 12 hour jet-lag, and one missed alarm too many because of swapping PM for AM was the last straw. I adopted 24 hour time and never looked back.</p>

<p>Even after rejoining the waking world, 24 hour time still had its advantages. For instance, instead of thinking of time as a trip around the clock, time was now a way to track how many hours are left until midnight.</p>
<p>Tell someone it's 9 PM and they'll tell you it's still early yet. Tell someone that in three hours today will be tomorrow, they'll be rushing home to get ready for bed.</p>
<p>24 hour time also makes it clear not just what time of day it is, but what day it is, period.</p>
<p>For some reason, in 12 hour time, the day begins at 12:00, the top of the clock, before rolling over to 1:00 for just one hour, then starting over again at noon. The only reason being because ancient timekeepers used sundials and liked to count on their fingers.</p>
<p>There is nothing intuitive about this whatsoever. It's only "easier" because we've become accustomed to it through years of ISO stockholm syndrome. Don't believe me? Try explaining 12 hour time to a six-year-old.</p>
<p>In 24 hour time, on the other hand, the day begins at zero and ends on twenty-four. Anything past that (yes, past that) is tomorrow.</p>
<p>And the older I get, the more minimalist I like my interfaces. 24 hour time has no colon between hour and minute, and eschews the AM/PM distinction entirely, anything after 12 00 naturally being afternoon. In my opinion, 24 hour time just looks cleaner and reads easier, leaving room for more important things.</p>
<p>"But then, everyone else uses 12 hour time!" is the staunch retort. "What happens when you have to communicate time to someone else?" To which I increduously reply,</p>
<p>When!?</p>
<p>Most everyone has access to a watch/clock/phone/GPS, so no one ever stops to ask anyone the time unless they're getting robbed at gunpoint. Computers automatically convert timestamps to your system settings, so it will display however the user is comfortable regardless. And when it comes to fringe examples like party invites, it's not that difficult to convert to 12 hour time for people that can't math because numbers make them break out in hives.</p>
<p>Mostly, switching to 24 hour time has been educational. I learned that opinions are not fact, just because an opinion is popular does not <b>make </b>it fact, and people will gladly perform twenty extra steps if it means not having to learn something new.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, that's their prerogative. And as long as no one tramples over mine, I'm okay with that.</p>
