<center><p><b>Forgotten</b></p></center>
<p>Last spring, our family went on a road trip. Instead of feeling the need for distraction like a root canal patient begging for Novocaine, I observed everything around me, noticing things I've never seen before,... such as the sheer amount of abandoned buildings dotting the landscape.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously. There were a lot of them. What`s up with that?</p>
<p>It wasn't long, though, until we saw one up close and personal, finding an abandoned fast food drive-thru while searching for lunch. Most everyone else was disappointed in the lack of food service and saddened by years marching on. Were these husks of a time long past, the product of recent hard times and economic downturn, or have they always been here and I've just missed them? But me? Disappointed? Saddened? Hardly. I found it utterly fascinating.</p>
<p>You see, in the most difficult times in my life, I've often become fascinated by the oddest things. Be it rabbits, snowmen, locks and keys, dominos, or mazes, each has helped me cope with the moment-to-moment tussels of life in one way or another, a small shred of something that makes sense in a world that makes as little of it as possible.</p>
<p>Abandoned buildings just happens to be my current "thing".</p>

<p>It probably had something to do at first with photos of old shopping malls no longer filled with shoppers and vendors. Sure, I have fond memories of malls from my youth, but between the association with unwanted travel and commute as well as my general distaste for shopping in general, I felt no real sense of loss. Just curiosity.</p>
<p>Later, learning how to embrace the outdated, to see it for what it was rather than for what it could have been, as history to be unearthed instead of trash to be discarded, I became attached to abandoned things and learned how to repurpose them, or at the very least, learn from its shadows and the stories it tells.</p>
<p>If walls could talk, right?</p>
<p>Now, as we've settled into the reality of living in a small space, my attachment to physical objects has dwindled. Elbow room and experience are precious, and though I wouldn't dare judge anyone else's collection of stuff, it has certainly shaped the way I see things. I don`t find abandoned buildings creepy or unnerving at all. They're a fact of life and, quite the contrary, I derive an odd sense of comfort from the fact that they exist.</p>
<p>All our lives, we are gated off from much of the world by any number of things: money, power, class, status, you name it. Seeing shopping malls and amusement parks, the champions of materialism, reduced to an empty tomb shrouded in dust and rubble, reclaimed by nature and welcoming to anyone with a camera and a sense of adventure, it's almost--dare I say--satisfying..</p>
<p>Or what about condos, mansions, and estates, once a symbol of exclusive opulence, home to the proud and haughty? Its owners are gone, its contents left for scavangers, gawkers and parasites. Once private property, a man's castle, is now a public time capsule, a museum for anyone to plunder through.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with having and enjoying finer things, but at the end of the day, that's all they are. Things. I cannot attain the status symbols to impress others, nor do I wish to. And you know what? I'm perfectly okay with that.</p>
<p>In a way, abandoned buildings remind us of this... bluntly.</p>
<p>Having actually done work for insurance agencies in the past, I've learned plenty about the industry via osmosis. As such, I have formed very strong opinions about minimalism and priorities, including what minimalism is and what it isn't. Perhaps it's less a passing fad and more about taking stock of what you really need versus what society foists upon you. After all, when you are so consumed with the fear of losing your stuff that you have to pay someone for the peace of mind of reimbursing you if it all blows away, maybe your stuff owns you, instead.</p>
<p>Does my fascination with the forgotten make me a bona-fide member of the minimalist club? Probably not. Just as owning a commemerative Elvis plate collection doesn't brand you as a hoarder. Eccentric, maybe, but not a hoarder.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thing I find most fascinating about the abandoned buildings of our world is not the stories they tell about its occupants, but what our feelings and reactions to them say about us as people. For me, it means that there truly is nothing new under the sun, and the sooner we learn this forgotten lesson, the sooner we can be content with what we've been given.</p>
