<center><p><b>Baba </b><b>is </b><b>You </b><b>and </b><b>Challenging </b><b>Your </b><b>Assumptions</b></p></center>
<p>I love puzzle games. Like... <b>really </b>love puzzle games.</p>
<p>Life is hard. And sometimes, oftentimes, life just stinks. Get thrown into endless, unfair, unwinnable scenarios with ever-changing expectations. Not so with puzzle games. With the right amount of clarity, attention and lateral thinking, any puzzle can be overcome.</p>
<p>However, true to good puzzle design, it's not fair to expect something out of a player unless it has first been taught. And no puzzle game drives home its mechanics and premise better than Arvi Teikari's Baba Is You.</p>
<p>The game begins with a simple idea. You are a critter named Baba. Walls are impassable. Rocks can be pushed. Touching the flag results in victory. All neatly spelled out with in-game text. WALL IS STOP. ROCK IS PUSH. FLAG IS WIN. BABA IS YOU.</p>
<p>Soon, you're taught that this in-game text is pushable and can be manipulated to make and break the rules of the puzzle to shift the tide in you're favor. "Yeah." you nod, as you go through the motions. "Okay. I understand." But really, you don't. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Then, this happens:</p>

<p>This little beauty is called "Grass Yard". When you first arrive, you are Baba and GRASS IS STOP is just out of your reach. The assumption is that the game is teaching you to make two statements using one "IS" within the confines of a walled garden. The game waits patiently while you beat your head against the wall.</p>
<p>Until you realize, nowhere does it say WALL IS STOP.</p>
<p>You walk up to the wall, and sure enough, you can pass right through. The game has just made it perfectly clear that nothing in Baba Is You has any intrinsic value of its own unless given to it by the game's rules, and the only thing keeping you within the four walls of the garden was your mistaken assumption of how the world works. Now you get it!</p>
<p>Every puzzle game must teach a player its mechanics, but the best puzzle games make them memorable by challenging a player's assumptions. The more unique the mechanics, the more important this becomes.</p>
<p>Mole Mania uses this to teach its two-layer underground mechanic. A Monster's Expedition uses this to teach its raft mechanic. Toki Tori 2 uses this to teach the power of its humble whistle/stomp mechanic. However, because of the rules Arvi Teikari had to teach the player and how masterfully, yet subtly, he pulled it off, Grass Yard from Baba Is You is one of the most memorable...</p>
<p>...and why it's one of my all-time favorites.</p>
