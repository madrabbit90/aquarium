<p>Americans have a problem keeping tabs on their stuff. Probably why climate-controlled storage became a booming business at the turn of the 21st century.</p>
<p>So too has the business of learning how to declutter. Just pin down your personality type, narrow down your needs, and find an organization method that works for you. (thanks, Cassandra Aarssen) There is no right or wrong answer... at least not for physical belongings.</p>
<p>Because, when it comes to files on our computers, the prevailing window, icon, menu, pointer (or WIMP) interface encourages digital clutter.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<img class="illust" src="images/clutter.jpg" />
<p>When it comes to organization, I am what some would call a butterfly. Everything I immediately use is on full display and everything else is out of sight, out of mind. I label things on the broad macro-level based on what function they perform or what they contain, and all these things are containerized in a first-in first-out basis. If I don't use something regularly, it's made clear at a glance.</p>
<p>This carries over to my computer. Files are named esoterically and plopped into a single folder. All my immediate functions are on display in a pretty, minimalist menu. It's easy to tell what is archived and what is unused at a glance.</p>
<p>But this obviously is not what interface designers <b>want </b>you to do.</p>
<p>Because the WIMP interface's skeuomorphs have roots in old-school file cabinets, Post-It notes and rolodexes, the intent is to micro-organize files into sub directories, label them with long, descriptive, flowery names based on the task at hand, and splatter your desktop with files and folders always at your fingertips.</p>
<p>As a "butterfly", this all makes no sense to me for several reasons:</p>
<p>Sub-folder hierarchy and descriptive names won't help me find files. Once a task is completed or enough time has elapsed, none of these labels will mean anything to me, and here I am shuffling through cryptic clues trying to reconstruct my train of thought from ancient history. This is why I rely on filetypes, content searches and timestamps to find what I need. Anything old enough can be safely deleted.</p>
<p>I also don't keep files and folders on my desktop for the same obvious reason I don't keep papers and folders splattered on my desk.</p>
<p>Most of this boils down to users adopting paradigms they don't fully understand. Folder hierarchy was not made for storing personal files. It was made for system structure and source code archives. Filenames were never meant for human eyeballs to rummage through. They were made to easily iterate through programmatically. Spreadsheets aren't prettier formatted lists. They're for holding, sorting, and calculating data.</p>
<p>And yet modern computers still come with a "shoot-yourself-in-the-foot" button that turns an easily searchable personal database into incomprehensible clutter.</p>
<p>On paper, the answer appears simple. Just do what's right for you. Except, that's easier said than done. PC manufacturers claim user freedom, but when there is a clear right and wrong way to use a system and users can be subtly "punished" for not playing by the rules, this all flies out the window.</p>
<p>As is. the alternatives seem to be the iOS style of stripping away all freedoms because the user is too stupid to know better and the Linux style of so much freedom that users migrate their bad clutter habits to a clean system.</p>
<p>But maybe that's the point.</p>
<p>Just like physical decluttering, there <b>is </b>no one-size-fits-all solution. And that's okay. The first step is knowing what works for you.</p>
