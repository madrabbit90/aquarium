<p>Hello world! This is my first blog post on my prototype content manager, Aquarium! I built this for two reasons: 1) to show my skills as a developer/designer and 2) because I wanted a good middle ground between Wordpress and Carrd. I couldn't find one, so I just made my own.</p>

<p>Visually it's servicable and very much designed for mobile devices, but under the hood, I can add content files, blog files and assets while the site auto-generates hyperlinks and formatting accordingly, all without needing a heavy frontend. Ideal for content creators with low bandwidth or limited workstation access (like me). The codebase is small as well to save costs on webspace and deployment.</p>

<p>As for the name, I rechristened the site "The Fish Tank" after a visual pun I drew.</p>

<p>Yeah... I'm easily amused. ðŸ¤£</p>

<p>I've got big plans for Aquarium, so stay tuned. Until then, have a great day and see you soon. ðŸ˜Š</p><meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url='https://madrabbit90.github.io/aquarium/?type=blog&page=test1'" />
