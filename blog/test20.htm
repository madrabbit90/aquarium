<title id="title">Oops All Fluff</title>

<center><p><b>Oops... </b><b>All </b><b>Fluff!</b></p></center>
<p>I read a post recently, the author jesting that the future of AI is using it to convert bullet-points into a lenghthy, eloquent email to others, while also using it to convert wordy AI generated emails into readable bullet points.</p>
<p>Funny? Yes. But, I'm starting to believe it.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, a shopping expedition at the mall. (you remember those, right?) You are looking for a specific item to finish a project. You know it exists, and you will not leave without it.</p>
<p>You're trying to find the store, but the store keeps moving farther away from you while irrelevant stores called "Recommended For You" shove themselves in your face.</p>
<p>Finally, you find a store whose signs advertise the exact item for which you're looking. Right down to the exact phrasing. Overjoyed, you run inside, rush to the counter, and inquire within.</p>
<p>"Oh. No, no, no." Says the salesclerk. "We don't actually have any of that. We just overheard you talking outside and put it on a big sign just to get your attention."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"But while you're here." he continues as your eye begins to twitch and your head aches, "Here are some other things you might be interested in..."</p>

<p>That's how it feels to search for simple answers in a post-SEO, AI generated webscape.</p>
<p>I was too young to remember the beginning of email, but I <b>do </b>remember the heyday of AOL when it became popular. I mean, when your catchphrase becomes the title of a Hollywood romcom, you know you've made it, right? Unlike "snail mail", we were promised instant messaging, no junk mail, and constant contact with our friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>Yeah... that didn't last long.</p>
<p>Apparently, email needed more splash-and-dash, so advertisers had a field day, defeating the entire purpose of the platform. So too did advertisers completely sap the joy out of creating a website and remove any element of fun whatsoever from social media. Nothing like trying to start a conversation and fighting "the algorithm" just to be heard.</p>
<p>Once advertisers realized they could pay and keyword-stuff their way to higher search engine rankings, so too came a flood of search hits that had absolutely nothing to do with your query, but performed well in analytics and encouraged them to keep doing it.</p>
<p>And now, AI chatbots are the new toy for advertisers to play with. Why pay hundreds for copywriters and graphic designers, they justify, when we can type some magic words into a prompt and cough up hundreds of pages of "content" that increases customer engagement for free? Engagement is what customers want, right?</p>
<p>In truth, all we really want as hobbyists and regular users alike is a fast answer to our questions. and all we get are professional looking AI generated, SEO ridden fluff-pieces that regurgitate our questions into content and make stuff up when it can't fill in the gaps. Computers talking to each other and leaving us out of the conversation.</p>
<p>Congratulations, advertisers. You have effectively created an echo chamber.</p>
<p>I hope you're proud of yourself.</p>
