<center><p><b>Pink </b><b>and </b><b>Blue</b></p></center>
<p>So, I was tuned in to business news on the radio one day and the talk turned to the topic of Thomas the Tank Engine. "Cool." I think as my ears perk up, "My kids love that show." I listen as the blurb went on, and the rights-holder of the property vowed to add more girl characters to attract a female audience.</p>
<p>A female audience?</p>
<p>"But wait... my kids are <b>girls</b>," I thought. "You <b>have </b>a female audience!"</p>
<p>Then, it occured to me. Even though Thomas the Tank Engine is a universally beloved character worldwide, you wouldn't know it upon walking into a Walmart, Target or Barnes &amp; Noble. The rights-holders in the U.S. chose to ostracize half its fanbase by choosing a demographic on which to laser-focus. And quite frankly, it's bafflingly stupid.</p>
<p>Our family loves Thomas, Bluey and golden-age Disney as much as the next family, but... really. When a TV show or property today finds footing in multiple demographics, blurs generational lines and is beloved by both boys and girls, men and women, it's lauded as something exceptional. Progressive. Unique.</p>
<p>But really, it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>Books in pre-radio days were enjoyed cross-demographically as families read them aloud around the hearth. Radio dramas in pre-television days were consumed cross-demographically as families listened to them in their living rooms. Same thing with TV shows amd films.</p>
<p>Now, granted, all things are not created for all people and not all things are age-appropriate, but this is different. This is modern, aggressive divide-and-conquer marketing that forces things into either the blue aisle or the pink aisle. This is why video games in America were agressively marketed to teen boys in the 90's, why the Hot Wheels aisle is little girl repellant, and why grown-ups are hard-pressed to find Bluey merch their size.</p>
<p>All this despite the fact that most "gamers" are thirty-something year old women, little girls will happily rummage through Hot Wheels and Matchbox at daycare, and a good chunk of Bluey's fanbase doesn't even <b>have </b>kids.</p>
<p>Yet we're all so used to this, that we forget how relatively recent this phenomenon actually is.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is, I know this doesn't have to be the case. Often we peruse smaller, boutique suppliers of more classic toys. Things like yo-yos, balls, blocks, puzzles, Lincoln Logs, Slinky's, the Potato Heads, Play-Doh, you name it. None of these are forced to be pink and blue. Toys are toys. They're meant to be fun for everyone. Hence why LEGO has such mass appeal.</p>
<p>True, certain activities leant themselves to better play for either boys or girls. Take for instance girls with kitchen sets and baby dolls. Not that boys <b>can't</b>, mind you, seeing as how many a world-class chef are men and caring for babies is a life skill that everyone needs to know. But it wasn't until the battle lines were drawn in the toy department sands that any of this mattered.</p>
<p>What struck me the most, watching Thomas the Tank Engine as a parent, is that on the isle of Sodor, Thomas is a friend to all children unconditionally, beloved by both boys and girls.</p>
<p>...and yet, in the toy department, it's either pink or blue.</p>
