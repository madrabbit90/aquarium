<p><center><b>The </b><b>Subtle </b><b>Art </b><b>of </b><b>Satire </b><b>in </b><b>Untitled </b><b>Goose </b><b>Game</b></center></p>
<p>Getting stuff can be fun, or... at least it used to be fun. As a kid, birthday parties and holidays were a prime time to rack up on loot. And space to stash it all? No worries! Stuff it under the bed, hide it in the closet or let the grown-ups take care of it.</p>
<p>When you, yourself, are a grown-up living in a small space with a wife and children, stuff takes on a whole new meaning. Stuff starts closing in around you, you need a place to store your stuff, holidays evoke anxiety for fear of more stuff and what to do with stuff. Try as we might, life revolves around stuff, stuff, and more stuff. And yet, for all the talk of becoming minimalist and spontaneous, we as people are defined by our stuff and our predictibility regarding our stuff.</p>
<p>Enter <i>Untitled </i><i>Goose </i><i>Game</i>, the smash hit 2019 indie sandbox game from Melbourne, Australia developer House House. In it, the player assumes the role of a mischevous goose in a peaceful English village and is tasked with making the biggest pest of one's self as possible. Plenty of grabbing, sneaking, running, pulling, honking and hilarity ensues, as players quickly find out that not only is being a horrible goose and causing public mayhem an absolute riot, but it's also wonderfully cathartic.</p>
<p>But what makes a simple game about a goose so funny? Nothing... not on its own, anyhow. Because, in my opinion, this isn't really a game about a goose. It's a game about people; very dense, silly people. It's a game about... <i>us</i>.</p>
<p>When playing through <i>Untitled </i><i>Goose </i><i>Game</i>, two things about the townspeople in which you are tasked with tormenting strike me as interesting:</p>
<p>First, for the most part, the goose never interacts directly with the townspeople, save for getting their attention with your trusty, dedicated "honk" button and encroaching on their personal space. All other interactions boil down to stealing their belongings and watching their reactions. Yes, that's correct. You interact with them by messing with their stuff.</p>
<p>Second, the townspeople are predictable. While true, this is a gameplay element most likely enacted to keep the experience fair and balanced, it's still exaggerated to the point of caricature. Townspeople will never leave their comfort zone unless you force them to, they all have an itinerary to follow and cannot be bothered to deviate from it, and if an object has strayed from its proper position, their top priority is to put their little world back to rights.</p>
<p>These rules are not mutually exclusive and are often at odds with each other. They certainly are in the game's act two. When the shopkeeper's need to keep a tidy stall and the boy's need to find his toy plane clash, the result is comedy gold. (make someone buy back his own stuff) It's like setting a Rube Goldberg mousetrap and watching it all come together. It really is something else.</p>
<p>No clearer can the themes of materialism and predictability be seen than in the game's third act, in which you must pit two next-door neighbors against each other to accomplish your horrible goosey goals. To break a vase, you must figure out that the gentleman's reaction to the artist lady's stuff on his patio is to throw it back over the fence. To steal the gentleman's slippers, you must figure out that during his morning tea, he always lifts one foot when sipping tea and the other foot when reading the paper. To decorate the plaster bust in the backyard, you must count on the gentleman's routine-induced blindspot and the artist lady's overabundance of collected junk overriding her common sense.</p>
<p>Not only does <i>Untitled </i><i>Goose </i><i>Game </i>call attention to the predictability and materialistic tendancies of us as people, but it also tasks you, the player, in exploiting and weaponizing it to accomplish your ultimate goal of swiping the golden bell and bringing it back to your lair in which the game began.</p>
<p>Which is doubly interesting, because upon backtracking down a small, worn path when the game begins, you'll spot a pit with a mound of buried golden bells, which implies that this is not an isolated incident, nor is it the first time this has ocurred. Does the goose like shiny objects? Does he perhaps dislike the shrill ringing of bells? I don't think so.</p>
<p>I think the bell tower in the miniature village sculpture represents the pinnacle of human arrogance and materialism. "See how important we are! Look at what we can build! Witness our accomplishments!" In one chaotic morning, the goose laughs at it all by tearing down the bell tower, stealing the town's crown-jewel, and leaving destruction in his wake. When the townspeople get a little too proud and complacent, the goose appears to knock them down a peg or two.</p>
<p>Or, you know, maybe it's just a game about a horrible goose taken at face-value, meant to provide some dumb fun and distraction. Maybe. But when a theme is repeated over the course of a work, be it a classic English novel or a modern Australian indie game, I tend to notice, and I can't bring myself to believe that it was't by design rather than chance.</p>
<p>And given that context, <i>Untitled </i><i>Goose </i><i>Game </i>remains either one of the silliest games ever made, or one of the most brilliant.</p>
<p>I'll leave that up to you.</p>
