<p><center>Shouting</center></p>
<p>When I first started designing concise user interfaces for small screens and specialized PCs, I eschewed all visual design language for textual menu-driven interfaces. Simple, speedy, and to the point. After all, one who uses a computer should learn to read, correct? At least, that's what I thought. Now, I find myself taking visual cues from a more consumer-friendly point of view while attempting to remain true to my minimalist computing vision.</p>

<p>All I wanted was a more intelligent user experience that made me more deliberate with how I use my computers and complete tasks, but in doing so, is a user interface paradigm shift away from textual labels in favor of more pictographic glyphs really a sign of mass illiteracy, the dumbifiation of society, and the downfall of mankind? I used to think so... but now I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<p>You see, being weary of the human voice seems like an absurd concept, as most people become so anxious in the midst of silence that they make as much noise as humanly possible to fill the void. However, as a self-proclaimed introvert, I can vouch for its validity. </p>
<p>Some years ago, I commuted to work on a daily basis, an hour round trip. Traffic and aggressive drivers became so stressful, that I ducked onto backroads as often as I could. When I arrived at work, it didn't take long for co-workers to file in and fill the space with chatter, small-talk, and top-40 radio hits where singers prattle on about nothing. And, of course, I worked in IT, so that meant that with every phone call, email, casual cubicle visit, and threat of being found during my lunch break, made my life that much more complicated.</p>
<p>I had to run the roads and go places during my lunch hour just to keep sane, which only helps so much, as any introvert will tell you: <i>People. </i><i>Never. </i><i>Shut. </i><i>Up. </i>Then, there was the drive home. Beachgoers turned a simple return home to the safety of my family into an engine-revving, speaker-blasting macho-man contest, and I needed afternoon radio programs to stay awake during the dreaded time changes when dusk was threatening to put me asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p>By the time I got home, I should have been ready to talk about our day and enjoy the chattering of my children, but instead, I was done with people. Utterly sick of people, their sounds, and their intrusion into my personal space.</p>
<p>So, what does this have to do with anything, much less user experience? More than you'd think!</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few years, and the most common irritant in interior decorating can be summed up in three words: <i>Live. </i><i>Laugh. </i><i>Love. </i>Where it was once trendy to have plaques, decals, t-shirts and throw pillows adorned with quotable quips, people are utterly sick of it now, and will avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p>At first, it seems like the fickleness of human fads strikes again, but one homeowner summed it up quite well: "It feels as though my house is shouting at me." And as a computer user, I can totally see that. Our computers <i>Will. </i><i>Not </i><i>Shut. </i><i>Up. </i>They ding, buzz, whirr and jingle over every trivial occasion. Every sender believes his message deserves your undivided attention, and every designer believes that his app or online portal is your one-stop-shop.</p>
<p>But it's not. It all adds up to a cacophonic mass of mixed messages. Notifications, reminders, menus, wordy emails and documents, ads, promotions, it's too much. In a swift move to shut out the noise, I put this together.</p>

<p>My most-used functions are front-and-center, and all I need to know (read: the time, battery and network) can be gleaned at a glance. If I need to get under the hood for more specific OS functions and configurations, that's what the terminal is for. No need to clog up an already cluttered start menu with them. But does resorting to a simple pictographic interface dumb things down? On the contrary, I believe it makes the experience <i>more </i>intelligent because it can get out of the way and let the user do what he needs to do.</p>
<p>Most desktop OSes work well on the showroom floor, acting as a showcase for all the potential functions the PC can perform, ensuring that the customer gets his money's worth. In daily use, however, what user will ever have to use every desktop function at a given time, much less be aware that they exist?</p>
<p>In daily use, it's just one more thing shouting at you. When everything is shouting at you, vying for your precious attention span already spread dangerously thin, it's little wonder that, given the choice, music has no lyrics, t-shirts and coffee mugs are blank, dashboard controls are universal, and user interfaces have as little text in them as possible.</p>
<p>And now that everything is quiet and I can hear myself think, I can finish my work, get to my projects, wind down with a puzzle, and maybe I'll finally finish that book I started... </p>
