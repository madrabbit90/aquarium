<center><p><b>Toy </b><b>Story </b><b>and </b><b>The </b><b>Importance </b><b>of </b><b>Defining </b><b>the </b><b>World's </b><b>Boundaries</b></p></center>
<p>At the end of a movie older than 2003, I sit back, sigh, and say, "They don't make 'em like that any more." Yeah. I am officially old. ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>Disney/PIXAR's landmark CGI animated film, Toy Story, is my favorite movie of all time. Not favorite kids' movie. Not favorite cartoon movie. No. My favorite movie. Period. The plot speaks to the grown-up fears of becoming redundant and replacable juxtaposed against the innocent backdrop of playtime in a child's bedroom. The characters are real and their struggles and motivations relatable.</p>
<p>It's easy to imagine, as a first of its kind, that the film's creators could just do whatever they wanted. No rules. Sky's the limit. And to that, I say:</p>
<p>That's not how movies work, my friend. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p>You see, movies have several factors working against them. First, movies are expensive. Animation, moreso. To come in under budget every scene must count. Second, the audience's attention span is only so long, so the opening scenes are crucial. And finally, love it or hate it. the medium is defined by its limitations. Add the additional issues of CGI hurdles and explaining your off-the-wall premise to a 1995 audience, and you have a real challenge in front of you.</p>
<p>But overcome they did, and within the first 10 minutes of the movie's runtime. How?</p>
<p>Watching Andy play with his toys is entertaining, but by the time you get to "Pull my string, the birthday party's today?" you already know several key points: How much Andy values his toys, a glimpse of the house layout, the fact that Andy and his family (no dad!) are moving, toys are alive but are not allowed to move when humans are present, Woody is extra special because he is the only toy allowed on Andy's bed, and an early birthday party can potentially cause a buzz (Ha!).</p>
<p>Get all that? Well, buckle up.</p>
<p>Because by the time we get to the "Plastic corrosion awareness meeting", we have been introduced to virtually the entire cast of characters, their dynamics and roles within Andy's universe, we meet Woody's best friend. girlfriend, and see that he is looked up to and respected as a trustworthy leader. He's not worried, so nobody should be worried (but he totally is), and he's beginning to lose his grip. *whew*</p>
<p>But for what seems like such a meaty, head-asplody info-dump of a movie opening, you probably never noticed this upon first screening. To your brain, it was just cool, entertaining, and "ooh, pretty!", but to the filmmakers, you now know the rules governing Toy Story's world, and the bulk of the narrative world-building has already been done.</p>
<p>Sneaky, but oh so brilliant.</p>
<p>At this point, you don't question green army men utilizing a baby monitor to establish a recon post in a potted plant. You don't question Buzz's delusions as an interplanetary cop. And you <b>certainly </b>don't question how Mr. Potato Head's parts work. You know how this movie works, and all this falls within the movie's boundaries. By the time we get to "Buzz! You're alive!", the fact that 90's CGI looks rough and dated is no longer relevant. We, the audience, are fully invested.</p>
<p>Truth is, immersion isn't as complicated as it sounds. Crafting a believable story is all about laying down rules, teaching your audience these rules, and not breaking immersion by breaking these rules. When Woody tells Sid's mutant toys that "...we're gonna have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help everyone..." we know <b>exactly </b>to what he is referencing, and it makes the toys' comeuppance and Buzz and Woody's forged-in-fire friendship all the more satisfying for it.</p>
<p>But seriously. If you have never seen this movie or it's been a long time, give it a watch. It's a timeless story that <b>should </b>need no introduction today, but is sadly taken for granted. Mostly because Disney and Hollywood learned the wrong lesson. PIXAR tried to teach us how to write stories, but we weren't listening. At least... not until Finding Nemo.</p>
<p>But Toy Story still has lessons to teach us about tight writing, good stories and resonating with an audience. It may have been the shiny newness of CGI that pulled audiences into theaters, but it was the masterful defining of the world's boundaries and limitations that gave the film its longevity.</p>
<p>It may not fly anymore, but it falls with style.</p>
