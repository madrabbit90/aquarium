<center><p><b>Utopia</b></p></center>
<p>HOT TAKE: Fragmention is not the issue. Lack of accessible open standards is.</p>

<p>Never assume that your user is running Windows, or even owns an x86 PC.</p>

<p>Never assume that your user has access to broadband internet.</p>

<p>Never assume that your user has a facebook and google account just because "who doesn't".</p>

<p>Never assume that forcing users to install an app or view a desktop site will lead to more engagement.</p>

<p>Never assume that your user reads and responds to emails instantly.</p>

<p>Never assume that your user will actually view images, preview text or oddball proprietary bells and widgets in said email.</p>

<p>It's no secret. I'm a Linux guy. I build my own rigs, configure my own systems and write my own tools. I used to want everyone to become Linux converts until I realized... that's not what free software is about.</p>

<p>When the Puritans landed in the new world, they were escaping tyranny of the crown and of the Church of England. Having tasted freedom, the Puritans built their own church and forced the colonists to support their own establishment.</p>

<p>Thus they became the very force they fought against.</p>

<p>In an ideal free software world, it's not a matter of converting everyone to Linux, but living in a world where it no longer matters.</p>

<p>Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, BSD, Haiku, RISC-OS, x86, ARM, it doesn't matter. It shouldn't matter. The moment you rail against standards and demand your users do it your way, you have become the problem.</p>

<p>Software freedom is an unobtainable Utopia that cannot exist unless we as users and developers alike are willing to respect established standards aa well as the standards of others. Just as everyone is different, everyone's setup is different. But everyone should have equal access to what he needs to accomplish his tasks regardless.</p>

<p>That's what free software is all about.</p>
