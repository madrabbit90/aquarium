<center><p><b>Forgiveness of the Eraser</b></p></center>
<p>I often hear the question, "Why would kids rather play video games instead of talk to real people?" But I believe we're asking the wrong question.</p>
<p>Why can't we forgive more?</p>
<p>When we were kids first learning to write, we noticed that a pencil has a sharp, pointy end that writes, but also has a soft, squishy end that rubs out stray marks and mistakes, giving you the chance to try again when you mess up. We were empowered to march forth, learn, try new things, all with assurance that our eraser would catch us when we fell.</p>
<p>Fast-forward years later. Our "pencils" have become more high-tech and sophosticated, but we still have erasers. Ctrl+z, undo, backspace, delete, savestate, respawn, home button, call it what you will, but the function is still the same. Empower the user to march forth, learn and try new things.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, pencils, paints and photoshop alike are only as powerful as the ability to undo and forgive mistakes.</p>
<p>Now look at school, a place where a kid will spend the majority of his childhood. It's an unforgiving wasteland where students are given expectations based on circumstances beyond their control, bullied on the basis of appearance alone, the permanent record is an ever-looming threat, and mistakes can irreversibly tank a GPA, ruining chances for higher education forever.</p>
<p>Or worse, being held back and labled "dumb kid" as they watch their "gifted" peers zoom ahead, given more opportunity because a subject just clicked earlier for them.</p>
<p>No pressure.</p>
<p>A game of Super Mario Bros., on the other hand, begins the same way for every player, gently eases the player into its mechanics when the player shows he is ready, allows the player to play through his mistakes without fear of failure, and when the player accidentally runs Mario into a bottomless pit or a muncher field, puts the player back on his feet with a clean slate, and says "It's okay! Try again!"</p>
<p>But surely things get better once we're older. wiser, and more mature. Right?</p>
<p>...right?...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the likes of anxiety and depression say otherwise. By the end of the day, we're just... done with people. Any delusions of making the world a better place are shot to pieces (just like our nerves), and the places and communities that <b>should </b>be a comfort to us make us feel like damaged goods.</p>
<p>We feel like we must perform our best. Have it all together. Make no mistakes. Lest the people we thought were our friends throw us away like last week's mayonnaise once we've outlived our usefulness. And that's what life begins to feel like. A performance.</p>
<p>And it's exhausting.</p>
<p>Small wonder then that we begin to crave the Ctrl+z's, undos, backspaces, and home buttons within the simplicity of text editors, cameras, and puzzle games, finding comfort in forgiven mistakes, equal footing and creative freedom.</p>
<p>Some even go further back to childhood and take in hand a notebook, a sketchpad and a pencil. Taking a stab at creativity with the sharp, pointy end that writes, and knowing that their mistakes can be forgiven with the soft, squishy end that rubs out stray marks and mistakes. And imagine, if only we could forgive like that.</p>
<p>With the forgiveness of the eraser.</p>
