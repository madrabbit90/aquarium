<center><p><b>Embracing </b><b>the </b><b>Niche</b></p></center>
<p>It was the turn of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The emergence of the Wal-Mart Supercenter spelled certain doom for local grocery chains, specialty shops, and mom and pop establishments all across the country. Why waste time and money going from place to place when you could purchase groceries, clothes, TVs, toys and tires all in a one-stop shop?</p>
<p>The very force that was meant to bring economic balance and competition back to the people was now shattering it left and right. And with the digital age bringing online giants to the forefront, Wal-Mart rushed to follow trends or lose profits. The days of the small shopkeeper were over. Long live the mega-store conglomerate. Embrace the future or die. It's the same thing that took out Blockbuster and Atari, right?</p>
<p>Except... that's not what happened at all.</p>
<p>As Wal-Mart built bigger and faster, duking it out with Amazon for low-price leader supremacy, specialty grocery stores, novelty restaurants, specialist and boutique shops, experts in their field, were able to not only co-exist in a post Amazon fallout, but thrive.</p>
<p>So much was made over whether or not small, locally owned businesses or lesser shopping chains could compete with the big dogs who could do everything. But come to find out, they didn't have to.</p>
<p>Just be happy being a small dog with a purpose.</p>
<p>Just be an expert in your field, provide a unique perspective, carve out your niche and do one thing well that no one else can do. Be patient. Embrace your niche. When the smoke settles from the flash in the stock-market pan, people will still need you. These are the businesses that are still around.</p>
<p>If the takeaway of the Netflix versus Blockbuster debacle is one merely of modernization and technology, we've learned the wrong lesson. Blockbuster had a niche carved out for themselves in its heyday, one that still exists today, regardless of digital streaming services.</p>
<p>The problem wasn't an unwillingness to change. It was an unwillingness to embrace their niche, expanding into sectors it shouldn't have and neglecting the customer base that made them a household name to begin with.</p>
<p>Imagine a Blockbuster classic movie theater. Blockbuster film guides and movie night snacks. A Blue Box, instead of a Red Box, on the corner of drugstores across America. That could have been a cool way to re-use all those abandoned phone booths.</p>
<p>The mind boggles.</p>
<p>The Atari company has become a relic of the past, not because of technology marching on, but because of mismanagement, leaders who don't understand the industry, and forays into cryptocurrency and hotels, among other things, that began during its hostile takeover long before the video game crash of '83.</p>
<p>The Atari <b>brand</b>, however, is still spoken of with due reverence and respect as the founding fathers of a respected industry and a creator of beloved classics that still hold up today. That niche is still there. All Atari had to do was embrace it.</p>
<p>As of writing, the current CEO of Atari is making strides in the right direction so... we'll see...</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong. I am not anti-big business and I'm all for forward progress. But it does my heart good to see an underdog succeed in business for no other reason than people trust him and he found his niche.</p>
<p>Because if he can embrace his niche and succeed, then so can I.</p>
