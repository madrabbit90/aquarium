<center><p><b>Wanted vs. Needed</b></p></center>

<p>A good teacher is one who works himself out a job. His proudest moment is when he is no longer needed.</p>

<p>I suppose job security is a reason to keep the populace dependent on one's goods and services, but as a software designer, I take a different approach.</p>

<p>First, job security is an illusion because times are perilous, everything changes and people (and their needs) are fickle.</p>

<p>Second, lording power over our users because we have the keys and they don't is unsustainable and childish. People are technologically ignorant and it's our own fault. We have become the problem, not the solution.</p>

<p>Instead of locking small businesses into predatorial contracts, why not take the software set aside for the large marketing budgets and package it in drag-and-drop templates, putting it within easy reach so even the mom and pop small businesses can hold their own against the new crowd?</p>

<p>We sell bloated software to users who will never use a tenth of its features. I'd rather hand the keys to my user and watch them drive away happily, knowing I'll probably never see him again.</p>

<p>The best computers I have built still run and update after 20 years. That's because I build digital companions, not ticking time-bombs. I want to give this security to other people, too. But its hard to beat a shiny new toy and a savvy sales pitch, innit?</p>

<p>Maybe I'm drying up my own well, but I would rather be trusted than needed.</p>
