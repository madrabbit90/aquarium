<center><p><b>One Thing Well</b></p></center>
<p>In my experience, the best tools on my computer follow the simple founding principal: "do one thing and do it well." As a result, I've been looked upon as a rebel for eschewing the Microsoft, Facebook and Google behemoths that the rest of the multitasking PC world has embraced. How else am I going to get "real" work done?</p>
<p>Well guys. come closer. I have a secret to tell you. It's a hard fact. but sooner or later, you have to know the truth. You might want to sit down for this one. Ready? Here goes...</p>
<p>People just aren't talented enough to drive and do <b>anything</b> else at the same time. We're just not built for it. In the race to ban the cellphone boogeyman from the highway, we learned the wrong lesson.</p>
<p>Hooray, no more texting and driving! And yet we still multitask. We multitask at our job. We multitask at home. Our computers force us to multitask. (now who's using who?) But the human brain does not naturally do two things at once. All we're doing is constantly shifting gears and trading doing one thing well for doing multiple things badly.  </p>
<p>Face it. People were not designed for multitasking.</p>
<p>Astounding isn't it?</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong. I am no luddite. Technology has made great advancements and, believe me, I'm all for it! But just because a server farm has the capability to run millions of instructions per second doesn't mean the human brain has suddenly developed to follow suit. And yet heavy-hitters in the software industry are bent on convincing us that we have!</p>
<p>Much to the annoyance of some, I don't get pinged every time someone sends me an email. I have to go out of my way to log in, read an email, process it, and craft a reply. I don't care that my responses aren't instant. I can assure you, inbox anxiety is real. I'm not some technophobe who dosn't know how to link a GMail account. I'm just a very bad multitasker who knows his limits.</p>
<p>Having vast desktop publishing tools in your word processor does not make you a better writer. Having calendar and spreadsheet integrations in your email client does not make you a better communicator. Having all social media platforms under one roof does not make you a better friend. To paraphrase Bill Watterson, it just makes you more harassed.</p>
<p>To me, learning Linux meant unlearning how to multitask. Once I stopped trying to find open-source versions of corporate solutions and learned to embrace the "one thing well" philosophy, I no longer had to multitask.</p>
<p>My email client read email. My text editor edited text. My word processor processed words. My web browser browsed the web. My clock and calendar clocked and calendared. I had multiple programs for image manipulation that all specialized in one specific aspect that made each one equally valuable.</p>
<p>To be fair, Android in its infancy came close with its embedded computer and bite-sized apps for singular tasks model... until integrations and advertisers completely shot it to pieces.</p>
<p>But isn't it easier to have one tool that just does it all? Spoken like a true late night infomercial pitch-man. (it slices. it dices. it makes julienne fries.) Multitasking is meant for the myriad tasks a computer can perform while we leave the office and raid the fridge for a turkey and cheese sandwich. Not for the user to juggle until his nerves are frayed thin.</p>
<p>Smaller, more specialized programs, usually written by single developers with a passion, feel cheapened by premium software packages engineered by teams of thousands from publically traded companies. But it's all a sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, our software demands that we do multiple things at once badly, but it wouldn't take much to let computers do what they were designed to do so we can do what we were designed to do.</p>
<p>"Do one thing and do it well." </p>
