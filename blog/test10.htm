<center><p><b>Mitford </b><b>and </b><b>Expositional </b><b>Efficiency</b></p></center>
<p>Jan Karon's <i>At </i><i>Home </i><i>in </i><i>Mitford </i>is one of my favorite books of all time. It's a cozy little read that hides real depth within its small-town charm. The characters are real, the plot is gripping, and the setting feels like you've been here before.</p>
<p>And it can teach us volumes about user experience and efficiency.</p>
<p><i>At </i><i>Home </i><i>in </i><i>Mitford </i>tells the story of a small-town Episcopalian minister who, at 60 years old, is burned-out and thinks that his life is winding down until life throws him a series of curves and misadventures. Between an enormous stray dog, a troubled foster child and a blossoming romance with his new neighbor, he realizes that his life is just beginning and God isn't finished with him yet.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of the book is how vividly the reader can picture the people and places in the mind's eye. To the point that creates this mandela effect of how vivid Karon's descriptions are. But in reality, Jan Karon's descriptions aren't at all that vivid.</p>
<p>In fact, Jan Karon really doesn't describe anything at all.</p>
<p>Let me explain...</p>
<p>See, Mitford doesn't waste its word count on flowery descriptions you'll probably just skim through anyway. Descriptions here are pretty basic. We know that people live here, homes are homey, gardens are colorful, and Mitford could be just about any other small town in the rural southern United States.</p>
<p>That's because none of this is important.</p>
<p>Instead, all the heavy lifting is done through dialogue, actions, how characters react and interact with each other, their routines, the words they use, what they find important, and sometimes, what they don't say at all.</p>
<p>Almost like a good radio drama, you don't need to be told that a character is young or old, sweet or cantankerous. You can hear it in how they speak and react to the main character. You don't need to be told that "The Grill" is a local hangout. You can hear it in the chatter and gossip swirling around the main action. You don't need to be told how special Mitford is because you see it through the personalities of the characters who live there.</p>
<p>Jan Karon isn't just trimming the fat here. Every word pulls double-duty. Nothing is lost, rather I became more invested in the characters and setting because everything I needed to know to enjoy the rest of the story can be summed up in the first five pages.</p>
<p>She doesn't just know her reader. She respects him, his time, and his mental capacity.</p>
<p>Efficiency isn't a term one immediately thinks when discussing pleasure reading, but when so much of our week is spent in "survival mode" and downtime is an exersise in finding room to breathe much less enjoying the things we love, expositional efficiency becomes a blessing, a love letter to the frazzled bibliophile in us all.</p>
<p>And this fictional trip to small town America is one we should not take for granted.</p>
