<center><p><b>Copy </b><b>That </b><b>Floppy!</b></p></center>
<p>Becoming the resident "Linux Guy" has given me a new appreciation for computer history. Sometimes in the age of cloud storage and streaming subscriptions, I get nostalgic for old storage media.</p>
<p>I also ponder strange things at 3 in the morning.</p>
<p>The 3 1/2 inch floppy diskette was one of my favorites. It was small and thin enough to be pocketable, but big enough to not get easily lost and washed with the laundry. The hard plastic shell kept data protected from the elements and the "dummy-proof" design made sure that anyone knew how to use them on a basic level.</p>

<p>However, the arrival of the cheaper, faster CD-ROM spelled the floppy disk's swift end. The diskette's lack of storage, slow write speeds and mechanical vulnerabilities gave way to the CD-ROM, then eventually DVD, Pen Drives and, Compact Flash cards.</p>
<p>But sometimes I wonder as I fish my micro SD card from the couch cushions and drip dry the flash drive that got washed with my pants. What if, in an alternate universe, advancements in floppy disk capacity and engineering outpaced the development of the CD-ROM and diskettes became the multimedia standard instead?</p>
<p>To me, floppies represent a simpler time when computers didn't take themselves so seriously and the iconography of the floppy was ubiquitous and something rich or poor, young or old, every user had in common. As someone who is "half-caff", embracing the digital yet craving the tangible, the '90s kid in me <b>loves </b>the idea..</p>
<p>Would Sony have developed the floppy-based successor to the Walkman? Would a new digitally encoded standard have allowed for movie releases on diskette? Would solid-state diskettes pave the way for game consoles, totally changing the landscape and normalizing digital distribution earlier? Would the current tech-scape look vastly different than it does now?</p>

<p>Probably not...</p>
<p>In the end, it wouldn't have mattered. When the dust cleared, SSD storage, the cloud and subscription streaming would have made the shootout pointless anyway. Most smartphone users nowadays aren't even aware that their devices can mount SD cards much less care. Gaming might look a smidge different, but would still homogenize with the shift to portability.</p>
<p>Except Nintendo sticking with carts. Coz, you know,... Nintendo.</p>
<p>So, in an alternate universe where a butterfly has flapped its wings on the other side of the globe and the scrappy diskette prevailed, would the tech industry have changed?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Would it have been cooler?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes it would. </p>
