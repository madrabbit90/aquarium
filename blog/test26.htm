<center><p><b>Road </b><b>Trip</b></p></center>
<p>When I was a kid, we took road trips during the holidays. And when you're a kid, road trips are exciting.</p>
<p>...or at least they start out that way.</p>
<p>Eventually, the experience melts into asking "Are we there yet?" every five minutes, fighting with siblings, and, when all else fails, blocking out the monotony with screentime, books and backseat activities.</p>
<p>So, after two decades of "stay-cations", I brought my family along on a road trip, following the same routes of my childhood, prepared for the monotony, impatience, and the need to pass the time.</p>
<p>But something was different.</p>

<p>As I listened to the old refrain, living my childhood vacations vicariously through my own children, I noticed that my focus was on the road, and not the destination. Everything was new to me. It had been twenty years since I traveled this well-worn route, and even the "boring part" of nothing but trees and billboards halfway there kept me entertained as I slipped on a pair of headphones and stared out the window.</p>
<p>I knew we would "get there" when we were supposed to, but it didn't matter when, and I didn't want to miss any of this.</p>
<p>Had my attention span simply become longer as I've gotten older? Was it just a case of no longer being a child and no longer needing to be incessantly entertained?</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>Do I no longer take things for granted as I did as a child, taking in every sight of old towns, overpasses, trains and marshland as if it very well may be my last? Every abandoned building, cozy neighborhood and footpath could tell a story and every bridge and rest-area a gateway to another world. How could I look away for even a minute?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is what the grown-ups meant when we were told "Just sit back and enjoy the ride." Youth are too focused on the destination. The directionless are too focused on the journey. Perhaps the best focus is somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Know where you're going, but appreciate each moment along the way.</p>
