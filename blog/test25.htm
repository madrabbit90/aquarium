<center><p><b>Half-Caff</b></p></center>
<p>On one side, there's the crowd that loves physical media, thumbing through DVD collections and smelling old books collected on a bookshelf. On the other side is the crowd that has fully embraced the digital lifestyle, storing family photos on Google Drive and Facebook while relying on streaming platforms for music, books and television.</p>
<p>Where do I fit? Somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Something about a lack of physical media is appealing to the grown-up's world of rambunctious children and ever-shrinking living space. An entire library can fit on a tabletop. I myself have my own digital library I've amassed over the years.</p>
<p>Public domain classics fill out my book reader, CDs are neatly ripped and can play on road trips without losing discs in the car seats. DVDs can be loaded on rotation like a jukebox without the risk of stompled movie cases, and my childhood game carts are dumped safely to a single SD card that can run on any Android or Linux devices.</p>
<p>Not that I don't <b>like </b>physical books, games, etc., mind you, it's just that at some point in my life, raw function takes precedence over making space for a pretty collection display to "ooh" and "aah" over.</p>
<p>And yet, I still like nice things, so there.</p>
<p>But by now, I'm sure you've noticed a pattern. All my digital media has root in the physical. Ripped discs, dumped carts, public domain books, photos backed up to a home fileserver. They all exist, tucked away in boxes, but I can carry them wherever and however with no need to allocate shelf space.</p>
<p>It's my personal collection.</p>
<p>This is where I lose both librarians and digital natives alike. On one hand, those that embrace the physical can't appreciate claustrophobia and need for consolidation, and cord-cutters wonder why I can't just get rid of it all and have it streamed to me. Do I really just want to have my cake and eat it too?</p>
<p>Well... yes, actually. Yes I do. ðŸ¤“</p>
<p>Besides that, though, I like ownership. It sounds loony, but the euphoric high archivists get when leafing through old books, I get the same dopamine hit when flipping through my legally and legitimately acquired files. They're mine, and no multi-billion dollar distribution deal can change that.</p>
<p>And it's not like I <b>completely </b>say "no" to digital media. At the end of the day, I will always pick ownership over convenience, but being half-caff gives me the freedom and shelf-space to indulge if I so wish.</p>
<p>I guess, too, I'll always be a tinkerer at heart. Paying to stream movies isn't fun. Building media centers and frontends, coaxing performance out of old hardware, just watching something run knowing in the back of your mind that a decade ago it was impoasible...</p>
<p>This is fun. Computers used to be fun. Media used to be fun. Am I crazy? Am I just a squirrel who can't pick a side of the road, waiting to ne run down by the Mack truck of progress?</p>
<p>Probably... but not without the complete works of Shakespeare in my back pocket. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
