<p>Nothing screams "elite hacker" like a multi-monitor setup with a good tiling window manager layout, and for good reason. They look cool, and, for programmers, developers and streamers, it's useful to see everything at once. But for everyone else, I'm not so sure. The more I watch people at work on their PCs, tablets and devices, I have to wonder... for all the maximalist setups being pushed by modern tech, how many of us average joe users actually need them? And if not, what is it that we're actually missing?</p>
<p>In the corporate office environment, prevailing ergonomics wisdom suggests that more monitors equals more productivity. This has in turn bled over into the home office environment where users feel that they must replicate their open-air cubicles to get any work done. But something about this notion bothers me. Not the idea of productivity, but the idea that the need for more screen real estate runs counter to the whole point of computers, which is using its computational power to save time, not complicate it.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that the need for more monitors, more peripherals, more desk space, does not mean more productivity, but indicates a deficiency in the way we interact with our workspaces. In other words, the reason why users feel cramped and constricted in their current setups is because everything they need isn't within reach.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely certain of the need to have a whole screen dedicated to emails to manually and visually parse through when humans can only read one message at a time, and a single message with a specific subject from a specific sender on a specific date can be pulled with a simple search. I'm also not certain why we still have to fumble through clumsy settings lists, menus, buttons and checkboxes when we have an auto-complete tool that can practically read our minds, instead of shoving web searches and paid subscriptions no one asked for in our faces. And I'm <i>definitely </i>not certain why filters and find functions, which would save inexperienced users a <i>lot </i>of headache, are hidden from them and are instead encouraged to treat the system like an archaic paper file and manually scan everything.</p>
<p>Then we laugh in their faces when human error inevitably occurs, because the problem exists between the keyboard and the chair.</p>
<p>The solution, to me, seems simple. Allow users to find any file or setting within the confines of the home screen; that includes emails. New emails can be seen within notifications, and an email editor does <i>not </i>need its own application window. Keep track of commonly used tasks to keep their launchers front-and-center instead of forcing users to rummage through the window stack. Give power back to the user. Spreadsheets and databases are, by nature, complex things, and no amount of coddling and dumbing-down will ever change that. And of course, use pre-existing, standardized tools instead of stubbornly insisting on re-inventing the wheel.</p>
<p>The benefits to the user would far outweigh the learning curve required, which would include smaller, more efficient desktops, lighter, more compact computers, and workspaces that can go anywhere and adapt to anyone. What makes this so obvious and within reach to a budding minimalist, but infuriatingly backward to the rest of the tech world?</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>Why would the tech world want to benefit the user when it can sell the user faster PCs, bigger desks, more monitors, more subscriptions, more tech-support, faster internet and longer working hours? As infuriating as it is, the world of technology is just like any other industry. The idea is to make the consumer feel so inferior about himself that he needs what you're selling. Empowering the user would rail against decades of progress. And thus, true user-friendliness is nothing more than a distant fairytale...</p>
<p>...and yet, at the same time, just within reach.</p>
