<center><p><b>Domino </b><b>Effect</b></p></center>
<p>Domino art (or chain reactions, kinetic art, or Rube Goldberg machines) is a beautiful paradox, a counter-intuitive contradiction of terms that makes it equally chaotic as it is calming. Small wonder that it gained a large resurgance leading up to 2020.</p>
<p>Set up a line of dominos, knock down the first one, and watch them all topple one-by-one. Lines can lead to walls, arches, various tricks and setups that are both technically demanding and mesmerizing. A clash of math and art that anyone can enjoy, but enthusiasts can truly appreciate.</p>
<p>Actually going hands-on with a box of toppling dominoes is where this becomes even more apparent.</p>

<p>In life, building something and having it "work" usually consists of a shiny, professional sheen that projects competence and aptitude. Domino art, on the other hand, succeeds in being entertaining while making as big a mess as possible. You want your setup to succeed, but in the back of your mind, you know it doesn't have to be perfect. After all, it's built for the sole purpose of being knocked down.</p>
<p>Thus, domino art doesn't last. It's fleeting. Like a solar eclipse. Like a shooting star. Like fireworks.</p>
<p>As much fun as toppling a setup can be, the final falldown isn't the reward, as there is no guarantee that gravity and physics will obey your carefully laid plans. Builders are forced to live in the moment and enjoy the pure thrill of doing something fun for no other reason than because it's fun.  </p>
<p>And when all is said and done, that's what it's about. Enjoy the moment. Get messy. Make memories.</p>
<p>Despite what the YouTube thumbnails suggest, the words "oddly satisfying" barely describe the world of domino art that I discovered during 2020. Domino art is calming.</p>
<p>Very calming.</p>
<p>I'm nowhere near ambitious enough to reach the dizzying heights of Lily Hevesh or Lyle Broughton, but domino art has become one of my favorite rainy day activities and a sure way to lower my heart-rate after a stressful day of striving for perfection and the fear of missing out. And to that, I echo the sentiment.</p>
<p>Thank you for making a mess of your living room just to entertain us.</p>
