<center><p><b>Personable</b></p></center>

<p>Recently, I read a sales blurb extolling the virtues of text messaging for business because "e-mail marketing is impersonal". And this ruffled my feathers a bit.</p>

<p>Actually, it irritated me.</p>

<p>A lot.</p>

<p>Having lived through Publisher's Clearing House junk mail, AOL, the dawn of text messaging, the creation of Facebook and Twitter, and the 2020 migration to Discord, calling any mode of communication "impersonal" seems hypocritical. Outside of face-to-face, one-on-one yammering at a coffee shop, aren't they all impersonal?</p>

<p>And let's be real. Are we really listening, or just waiting for our turn to talk?</p>

<p>Writing letters was merely a necessity back in the days before cheaper mass transit guaranteed a safe arrival to loved ones in a matter of days instead of a harrowing handful of months. No one waxed lyrical about the "personability" of penstrokes and sweat-stains. And no one complained when the telegraph office made messages shorter and faster.</p>

<p>No one complained about the "impersonality" of email when users could cut through the cruft of junk mail and have nearly instantaneous conversations with friends and family worlds apart. That was, of course, until marketers found another prime target and junk mail found them.</p>

<p>No one complained when texting, instant messaging and facebook cut out the middleman and put communication on user's terms. That was, until marketers wanted a piece of the action. Newsfeeds filled up with ads and useless posts, and every ping became a "nag notification".</p>

<p>Now, nostalgia has taken hold and people long for the more "personable" and "tangible" days of paper and ink. All this to say:</p>

<p>Blah!</p>

<p>There was nothing more "personable" about paper and ink, horse-and-buggy, Little House on the Prairie rose-tinted days. All people want is a space of their own where work and advertisements can't nag them to death. Marketers would have slapped ads on the side of Pa Ingalls's covered wagon if they could have got away with it.</p>

<p>And this is why we can't have nice things.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, all anyone really wants out of a communication platform is a way to find the people he cares about the most, reach out to people in times of need, and talk about things that are important to him. Everything else is just marketing fluff.</p>

<p>And you know what? Even without the pony express, that's something we all can achieve.</p><meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url='https://madrabbit90.github.io/aquarium/?type=blog&page=test31'" />
