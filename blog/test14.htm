<p>So, I finally did it. I finally bought a brand-new computer.</p>
<p>"And why not?", you might ask. People buy a new computer every couple of years after their old computers wear down, right? But, anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm not exactly a new computer kind of person. I used to rescue old computers from the rubbish heap and build concept cyberdecks from spare parts. You see, I haven't bought a brand-new computer in some 20-odd years.</p>
<p>And why should I?</p>
<p>Here's a brief history:</p>
<p>My final straw with Windows came from a pre-loaded Windows XP laptop, my first and last store-bought PC, a system I had to fiddle with for weeks to make it do what I wanted and was finally happy with. That was until the OS broke down. With my personal files stranded on a dead PC, the promise of a new computer was of no comfort. I continued using it, though, after backing up my files with a Linux live-CD and reinstalling Windows. However, I never forgot that spark of hope Linux offered me when the industry just wanted to sell me prettier, shinier things.</p>
<p>My first Linux machine was a newer laptop my sister deemed worthless because it couldn't run Windows, but after my last experience, I gave it a second chance running Ubuntu and later, Debian. I learned the system's ins and outs, and it became mine. I used it as a laptop until the case tore apart, then used it as a desktop until it gave everything it had.</p>
<p>This experience taught me how to be technologically self-reliant.</p>
<p>When my wife and I were still dating, I offered to take a look at her old Windows XP laptop that her brother deemed only fit for the rubbish bin. Having become adept at installing Debian on old machines, she gave me permission to pull the trigger and never look back, having nothing else to lose. That computer lasted 10 more years and still runs like a top to this day, only being retired due to lack of space.</p>
<p>This experience taught me to stop seeing slow computers as a fact of life and to use smaller, more specialized programs and open standards that got the same jobs done for less memory overhead. By the time my parents acquired their cobbled-together Compaq desktop, the Debian-ized Apple eMac, and I, my eeePC netbook from eBay, my franken-builds were running rings around anything on the showroom floor.</p>
<p>I also had a dream for what computers <b>could </b>be instead of just accepting them for what was available on the market. I began to build handhelds and hybrids, experiment with input methods and screen-sizes, turned small desktops into home media consoles, repurposed giant early 2000's business laptops into dedicated VNC servers.</p>
<p>But it never seemed to matter, and I was tired.</p>
<p>I had to face facts. New off-the-shelf PCs were not for me. All I would do with a new computer is replace the hard-drive, install Debian, modify the case and void the warranty. I wasn't accustomed to computers telling me what to do, but trying to get what I wanted out of a disposable product destined to be nothing more than e-waste was both exhausting and discouraging.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it happened. The world went mad and all my wildest tech-dreams came true.</p>
<p>Valve releases the Steam Deck, computers are smaller than ever, ARM is holding its own against AMD and Intel, RISC is relevant again, average Joe Consumer is demanding his right to repair, users are railing against the establishment, Framework and Clockwork Pi are making modular computing cool again, and open source is for the working people, not just underground geek culture. I don't know what parallel universe I just stepped into, but I am loving it.</p>
<p>Then, for the first time in, like... ...ever, I found myself drooling over a brand-new computer that I wished I could have built myself.</p>

<p>The Clockwork Pi uConsole.</p>
<p>It's handheld, so I can bag it up and use it anywhere, any time, but can dock as a desktop should the need arise. It's modular and open-source using off-the-shelf parts, meaning easily repairable and upgradeable, and can run my favorite Linux distros out of the box. Supply chain issues are keeping it out of my hands for the time being, but commercial instant-gratification can wait. It's worth it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. Of course that's the kind of computer Mr. Picky Linux Guy would buy. Will it be perfect? Of course not. But I shouldn't be looked upon as some sort of rule-breaking maverick for wanting a PC I paid money for to listen to me, and for once, I can get that experience out of the box just like any other paying customer without putting up a fight. And after over 20 years of fixing up old computers just to not be treated like a second-class citizen, I'm not sure what to think of that...</p>
<p>...but I'll keep you posted.</p>
