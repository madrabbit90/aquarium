To those selling intangibles:

Empathy is vital.

I have no idea what I need. I am not coming to you because you sell an awesome product. It means nothing to me. I've done my research, but it makes no sense. You are so steeped in your profession that you have forgotten. I wouldn't know and I don't care.

That's why I came to you.

I come to you because I trust you and you know your stuff. Get to know me. Comfort me. You tell me what I need. If you wait on me to communicate what I want and need, your sale is gone.

I live in a world of "do this", "sign that", "provide this", "answer that". Your product is just a necessary evil that I was told by the powers-that-be that I needed.

Insurance, home loans, auto repairs, whatever, you name it, it doesn't matter. All I want from you is listen to me and give me a list of things that I no longer have to worry about.

Do this and you will have earned my trust...

...and a customer.
