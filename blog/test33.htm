<center><b>uConsole: My Experience</b></center>

<p>A few weeks ago, my new computer finally arrived, the ClockworkPi uConsole. It's a handheld "cyberdeck" PC built on the aarch64 architecture of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. It comes in a boxed kit, requiring the user to pre-assemble it. I had read plenty of negatives along with the positives regarding this device, among these being slow speeds, the need to be a tech-savvy tinkerer, and the absurdedly long turnaround times for shipping. Regardless, this was the device I had wanted and dreamed of for years and, lo-and-behold, it now actually exists! Besides, I'm arthritic, and sitting at a desk for long periods of time, typing, and lugging equipment about is horribly painful. Having an ultra compact computer I can curl up with on my own terms appeals to me in my middle age.</p>
<p>So after a few weeks going hands-on with the uConsole, was it worth the wait? Is it better than buying a laptop? Short answer: yes,... for me,... but very likely not for everyone.</p>
<p>The Setup:</p>
<p>If all you want to do is plug a computer in and browse facebook, this computer is not for you. Right off the bat, the uConsole is shipped unassembled and it's up to you, the end user to put it together like a hi-tech LEGO set. The kit comes with a pre-installed Raspbian SD card to get you rolling, but hold on a minute! If you want to get the most out of your device, you'll need to source your own batteries, flash a disk image provided by the community, manually expand the main partition, flash custom firmware to the keyboard, and install a suite of desktop applications to your liking. And then there's dealing with the pesky exposed screen issue. (more on that later)</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, the ClockworkPi forums and the official Discord server are super helpful and will provide you with more than enough tech support to get you going.</p>
<p>If all this sounds daunting, that's because... well... it's supposed to be. Outside of being "part of the experience", each of these steps gets you increasingly acquainted with the innards of a fully upgradeable, repairable and moddable computer that puts you, the user in the driver's seat. Clockwork is not your mum. If you can figure out how to do it, the uConsole <i>will </i>happily step back and let you be the boss.</p>
<p>If any of this breaks you out in cold sweats, you're probably better off with a Chromebook or an iPad. If you're still with me, let's move on.</p>
<p>The Chassis:</p>
<p>The body of the unit is made completely of metal. If you're used to smartphones and ultrabooks, the uConsole is a chunky little guy in comparison. This does two things. Unlike most plastic devices, the uConsole actually feels sturdy in the hands, and unlike other active cooled devices, the case serves as a giant heat-sink, keeping the CPU cool while staying completely silent.</p>
<p>Do you hear that? Yeah... neither do I.</p>
<p>Modern laptops crumble apart so easily. Sleek and stylish smartphones need NERF cases before taking them out in public. Even upon playing the Nintendo Switch for the very first time, I felt as if I were going to accidentally snap the silly thing in half. The fact that Switch 2 will be just as thin but increases overall surface area triggers my anxiety. Not so with this computer, in which I fear smashing my foot to pieces rather than my device in the unlikely event that I drop it.</p>
<p>My only complaint was the fact that the screen is left completely exposed to dust, elements, and the risk of being impaled. Why? I'm not sure, as this is not a touhscreen device. Any pointer interaction is handled entirely with the onboard trackball. As I intend to use this device on the go, I had to immediately address this design flaw with a self-crafted screen shield.</p>
<p>The Hardware:</p>
<p>Otherwise, much thought went into the hardware design of the uConsole, and it shows. The keyboard, though small, is laid out well, very comfy to type on, and provides a nice mechanical "clicky" feedback. Although a little top-heavy when using the keyboard, this was never an issue with me as most of my typing sessions involved it sitting on my lap or a pillow. The "gamepad section" of the keyboard, which houses the d-pad, face buttons and trackpad, puts the hands at the unit's midsection to balance the unit for quick gaming sessions and handheld navigation.</p>
<p>The power button and SD card slot are recessed into the unit well enough to avoid accidental power cycling or hard drive removal but are still easily acessed blindly. The wifi antenna is attached with adhesive to the top of the case. Realistically, it's in no real danger, but its placement on an all-metal casing means signal strength takes a hit unless you're willing to do a little light tinkering with a plastic shim.</p>
<p>The screen is small, but should handle most use cases with ease. It gets plenty bright and can be easily adjusted in-software. It's also one of the many elements of the unit in which it's important to keep your expectations in check. Which brings us to...</p>
<p>The Performance:</p>
<p>Make no mistake. The uConsole is not a gaming rig or an industrial powerhouse. It was designed for size, ruggedness and battery life first and foremost. Even still, I'm constantly surprised and amazed at the things this little guy <i>can </i>run, and run well.</p>
<p>Along with productivity apps and emulators in the Debian repos, with Box64, Box86 and Wine, it can run Linux desktop apps and games that cannot natively be recompiled for aarch64 as well as a healthy plethora of Windows applications that should fill in quite a few gaps. The screen size can sometimes be an issue, as the OS comes shipped with a mouse and window interface built for a 30-inch 4K ultrawide screen. The uConsole is perfectly capable of connecting to a full-sized HDMI monitor and a powered USB hub, but I haven't tried this as of yet since most of my time with the device has been using it on the couch or in bed. Most users swap to a tiling or fullscreen compositor with keybindings that feel more at home on a tiny laptop (I personally use Matchbox and Rofi), but it does require some tinkering and a bit of trial and error.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, I am not a modern gamer or a video editor. I write, draw, code, and play retro and puzzle games, so take my assessment with a grain of salt. This entire review was written with my uConsole and Wordgrinder. ;)</p>
<p>The lightweight nature of the system means less familiarity to Windows and Mac immigrants, but it also means that boot times are fast, the OS feels snappy, and the battery life will last for hours between charges (provided you didn't cheap out on the power cells, of course). With some digging and creativity, anything you can do on a full-sized laptop, you can do here. And because the uConsole is designed to be disassembled and updated, I can easily grab a CM5 (once the prices drop) or a Radxa and boost the performance even further.</p>
<p>What I Think:</p>
<p>The only thing that soured my experience with the ClockworkPi uConsole was the protracted shipping times due to the company being a small startup, the product being made to order, and the availability of the CM4 still reeling from pandemic era scalpers. I was willing to stick it out because, to me, the uConsole is more than just a new toy. It's the future of portable, minimalist, off-grid computing, and I can't wait to see more of it and where it's headed.</p>
<p>However, I don't live under a rock. I know that it's not for everyone, as it not only requires a degree of tech know-how (or stubbornness, in my case), but a specific mindset and a willingness to learn knew things and build new tools, even if that means not jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge just because everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>Either way, at the end of the day, I think the uConsole is a perfectly usable, capable, and cozy computing experience... just as long as you have the pioneer mindset and you're willing to put in the work.</p>
