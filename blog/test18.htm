<p>Anyone who does computer, tech or programming work of any capacity will tell you that school doesn't end when you throw your mortarboard caps in the air. The landscape is always changing, so it's helpful to be constantly learning from those who have more experience. So is staying motivated to learn.</p>
<p>We all know that education is less about filling an empty head with knowledge and more about igniting the flame and teaching students how to seek knowledge for themselves. Teach a man to fish and all that sort of thing. If we had a nickel every time someone said this, <b>we </b>could eat for a lifetime. I've uttered this phrase so many times because this is the education I wanted for my own children.</p>
<p>But now I know what it actually looks like in practice.</p>

<p>Learning is much easier when the teacher is enthuaiastic, and it's easier to be enthusiastic when you yourself are learning along with your students. And anyone will tell you, enthusiasm is contageous.</p>
<p>One of the most devastating barriers to homeschool I have ever seen is the notion that not knowing everything there is to know about a subject makes one unqualified to teach it. Granted, it has its place, but brushing-up alongside your student has dual benefits.</p>
<p>You'll approach the subject from a fresh perspective and your student will see learning as something fun and engaging because you, yourself <b>are </b>having fun! And let me tell you. From personal experience, it works.</p>
<p>Just put your imposter syndrome aside for a few moments and let yourself enjoy it, 'kay?</p>
<p>The most memorable pastors I have sat under are the ones who grow in the faith along with their congregations. The most endearing teachers are the one whose sujects live on the outside of the four walls of a schoolhouse, not just buried collecting dust in a textbook. The most charistmatic tech vloggers are the ones who are always discovering new things and find genuine excitement in telling others.</p>
<p>They don't just speak with authority from a lofty point. Learning is messy, and we need someone who is willing to trudge through with us, as waste-deep in the muck as we are. Someone who doesn't have all the answers but can lead us there.</p>
<p>Chasing the spark that ignites the flame is important for the student, of course, as it sets the patterns of his education and empowers him to seek knowledge boldly on his own. But for the rest of us, it does something far greater.</p>
<p>It empowers us to look past our qualifications and teach boldly. </p>
