  <b>Greetings!</b>

<p>Hi everyone. I'm a web designer/developer. I design cool things for my friends and family, and I'd like to design some cool things for you! ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>I am most at home with Linux. I know my way around Bash, Python, Lua, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and C++. If a tool doesn't exist, I build it. In fact, this site was built using nothing but my phone and a text editor.</p>

<p>My dream is to take on design clients and work remotely to ease the stress of my arthritis-addled brain, not be chained to a desk, and be present in my family life.</p>

<p>I have no ego. I'm always learning. All I want to do is pour a cup of coffee, put on some headphones and build cool things.</p>

<p>I'm building a portfolio website here. It's small right now, but follow me! I'm always updating!</p>
